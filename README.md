# Prework Webpage Ray Ponce

## Description

This is the Prework to start the Bootcamp. The main motivation is to start learning how to use all the tools that I will use along the course.

I built this project to start my studies. It helped me to have an idea of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to use the Github.

I learned the basics of HTML; CSS; JS and GitHub.
